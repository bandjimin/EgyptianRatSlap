## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java (Programming Language and Collections Framework), Object-oriented Programming

This project was built using Java and focuses on implementing **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and **Java Collections** to create a text-based simulation of Egyptian Rat Screw (ERS). The game logic includes **player turns, card slapping mechanics, face-card challenges, and pile management**. The simulation autonomously runs a game by dealing cards, enforcing ERS rules, and printing a log of events leading to the final winner. The core data structures include **LinkedLists** for player hands and the central pile, ensuring efficient card operations. The biggest challenge was designing a fair and responsive game loop while handling simultaneous player actions and random events.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this project reinforced the importance of **efficient game loops, modular OOP design, and Java Collections** for managing dynamic data. Debugging player interactions and slap mechanics provided insight into **event-driven gameplay** and **randomized simulations**.  

Working solo highlighted the value of **structured problem-solving and thorough testing**. Iterative debugging and careful documentation were essential for refining gameplay mechanics and ensuring rule enforcement.
